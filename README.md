# Hermes

Building An Interpreter from Scratch in Golang and written using NeoVim.

Hermes, the messenger of the gods, is often associated with communication, 
language, and interpretation. He is known as a guide, translator, and mediator 
between realms. His attributes can be linked to interpretation, especially in 
the context of language and communication.

### What we are building?
We are building an interpreter which is a program that directly executes or evaluates a code written in a high-level programming language. It reads the code, line by line or statement by statement, and immediately translates and executes each line into machine code or intermediate code, without the need for a separate compilation step.

### Why we are building an interpreter?

### Lexer
Lexing, also known as lexical analysis, is the initial phase of processing in a compiler or interpreter for a programming language. A lexer, short for lexical analyzer, is a component or program responsible for performing this task. Lexing involves the analysis of a sequence of characters (often the source code of a program) and breaking it down into smaller units called tokens.
